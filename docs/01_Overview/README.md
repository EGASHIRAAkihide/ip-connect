# 01_Overview — IP Connect

## Overview

IP Connect is an online licensing and rights-management platform that makes it easy and safe for companies to use creators’ digital IP (voice, illustrations, dance, music, etc.).

We connect:
- Creators who own original IP but don’t know how to price, contract, or negotiate
- Companies that want to use IP for ads, games, VTubers, local promotion, etc., but are afraid of legal/rights issues

---

## One-liner

> IP Connect is a marketplace and rights layer that lets companies safely license creators’ digital IP with clear terms and simple online approval.

---

## Why Now?

- Explosive growth in digital content (VTubers, K-pop, TikTok, AI-generated content)
- IP is used globally, but licensing workflows are manual, fragmented, and risky
- Creators are going international faster than existing rights-management systems can handle

---

## Vision

Enable a world where creators’ IP can be used globally with:
- Clear rights
- Fair pricing
- Traceable usage

---

## Initial Focus

- **Categories:** voice actors / VTubers, illustrators, choreographers
- **Geography:** Japan/Asia creators × global companies and agencies
