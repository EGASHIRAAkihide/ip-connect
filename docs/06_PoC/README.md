# 06_PoC — IP Connect

## Overview

Goal: validate demand for a unified, standardized IP licensing workflow among creators (voice, illustration, choreography) and companies. The PoC measures willingness to adopt, clarity of workflow, and appetite to move away from DM-based negotiation.

---

## 1. PoC Hypotheses

- **Problem:** creators and companies face friction, risk, and inefficiency due to the lack of a unified licensing system.
- **Solution:** a simple standardized workflow will reduce negotiation time, increase trust, boost licensing frequency, and lower rights violations.
- **Success:** creators and companies actively use the workflow and express willingness to adopt beyond the PoC.

---

## 2. Scope (What We Test)

- **Creator side:** upload IP (voice sample, image, choreography video), define simple usage terms, set basic price range, publish a temporary licensing page.
- **Company side:** view listings, submit structured licensing inquiries, receive written usage terms, experience faster approvals.
- **Logging:** record inquiry, approval, terms, and contact info (no blockchain/payments needed).

---

## 3. User Groups

- **Creators:** 5 voice actors, 5 illustrators, 5 choreographers (total 15)
- **Companies:** 3 indie game studios, 3 VTuber/streamer groups, 2 ad agencies, 2 YouTube/TikTok teams (total 10)
