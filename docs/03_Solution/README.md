## 1. Core Solution

- Clear pricing and usage terms up front
- Single inquiry → approval workflow instead of scattered DMs
- Digital proof of rights with traceable logs
- Global access across categories and regions

Creators gain monetization and protection; companies gain speed and legal clarity.

## 2. Key Product Pillars

### Pillar 1 — Unified IP Listing Page

Creators get a public licensing profile to:
- Upload IP assets (voice samples, illustrations, choreography videos)
- Set usage terms, regions, exclusivity, and pricing tiers
- Offer commercial license options and show past collaborations

Purpose: eliminates “DM chaos,” standardizes price and usage, and makes IP instantly discoverable.

### Pillar 2 — Standardized Licensing Workflow

1. Browse IP by category (Voice / Illustration / Dance)
2. View predefined usage terms (allowed usage, regions, platforms, duration, exclusivity, price)
3. Submit a structured licensing request (purpose, budget, campaign, timeline)
4. Creator approves/rejects/modifies terms
5. Log who approved, when, and for which project
6. Optional invoice/payment (v2+)

Purpose: companies gain legal clarity; creators gain safety and revenue; approvals are trackable.

### Pillar 3 — Rights & Usage Tracking (Audit Layer)

- Store deal history, usage terms, renewal dates, regions, exclusivity duration, and approver identity
- Act as a lightweight “IP rights ledger” (blockchain optional later)

Purpose: prevent misuse, provide proof, and simplify audits for both sides.
