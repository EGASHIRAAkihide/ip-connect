# 05_BusinessModel — IP Connect

## Overview

IP Connect monetizes by operating a hybrid Marketplace + SaaS + Enterprise Licensing API model for creator IP (voices, illustrations, choreography, character designs). Revenue scales with transactions while SaaS provides predictable recurring income.

## 1. Revenue Streams

### Marketplace Commission (Primary)

IP Connect takes a percentage of each licensing transaction.

| Category | Typical Licensing Price | Platform Cut |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Voice (VTuber/Ads/Game) | $150–$2,000 | 10–20% |
| Illustration / Character | $100–$5,000 | 10–20% |
| Choreography | $300–$3,000 | 10–20% |

Projected average take rate: **15%** (comparable to Airbnb 10–15%, Shutterstock 20–40%, Fiverr 20%). As IP usage grows, platform revenue scales automatically.

### Creator SaaS (Subscription)

| Plan | Price | Features |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Free | $0 | Listing page, basic terms |
| Pro | $9–$15/mo | Unlimited assets, analytics, custom terms, portfolio |
| Studio | $29–$49/mo | Multi-member teams, rights logs, contract templates |

Target users: voice actors, illustrators, agencies, VTuber indie teams.

### Company SaaS (B2B)

| Tier | Price | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Basic | $99/mo | License management dashboard |
| Pro | $199/mo | Multi-project rights logs, approval workflows |
| Enterprise | $399+/mo | Custom terms, API access, usage audits |

Ideal for ad agencies, VTuber agencies, game/anime studios, and production companies.

### Enterprise Licensing API (Future)

- Use cases: rights checks for games, agency workflows, AI tools verifying licensed input assets
- Pricing: $0.01–$0.10 per rights check; $1,000+ monthly enterprise plans

## 2. Example Unit Economics

- **Licensing deal (voice actor):** $300 price × 15% = $45 platform cut; near-zero cost → ~95% gross margin
- **SaaS (creator $15/mo):** marginal cost ~$0.50 → ~97% margin

High-margin digital workflows make the model highly scalable.

---

## 3. Pricing Experiments (PoC → MVP → V2)

- **PoC (manual):** fixed 10% commission for simplicity
- **MVP:** 10–20% commission; Creator SaaS $0 / $15 / $49; Company SaaS $99 / $199 / $399
- **V2+:** contract upsells, API calls, international fees, payment processing fees

## 4. 3-Year Revenue Outlook (Illustrative)

Assumptions: 10k creators, 2k companies, 8% monthly licensing activation, $200–$800 average deal size, 15% commission, 10% SaaS conversion.

| Year | Transaction Volume | Platform Revenue | Creator SaaS | Company SaaS | API/Enterprise | Total |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Year 1 (JP/Asia) | $1.8M | $270K | $180K | $120K | — | ~$570K |
| Year 2 (Global expansion) | $6M | $900K | $500K | $350K | — | ~$1.75M |
| Year 3 (Network effects) | $15M | $2.25M | $1.2M | $800K | $500K | ~$4.75M |

## 5. Why This Model Works

- Marketplace fees compound with usage growth
- SaaS adds predictable recurring income for creators and agencies
- API integrations create enterprise stickiness and high switching costs
- Purely digital workflow yields 90–97% gross margins
- IP is borderless → revenue globalizes naturally

## 6. Business Model Advantages

- Multi-category coverage (voice + illustration + choreography) that competitors lack
- Transaction data becomes an asset (pricing, usage patterns, regional demand) enabling AI recommendations
- “Creator rights layer” creates defensibility as a trusted infrastructure partner
