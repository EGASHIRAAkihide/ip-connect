# 02_Problem — IP Connect

## Overview

Digital IP (voices, illustrations, choreography, characters) is spreading globally faster than the licensing infrastructure that protects it. Creators and companies both face friction, legal ambiguity, and operational risk because no unified workflow exists. This document summarizes the core problems IP Connect addresses.

## 1. Voice Actors / VTubers — “Invisible Rights”

Voice IP is heavily reused yet poorly protected. The market is growing rapidly (VTubers, AI voiceovers, localization), but licensing remains chaotic.

- Non-standard pricing and negotiation
  - Rates vary drastically by creator, no shared reference for usage fees
  - Negotiations happen via DM, leading to misunderstandings
- Secondary usage ambiguity
  - Clients re-use audio beyond scope, overseas usage often undisclosed
  - No tracking or written proof after delivery
- No safe international workflow
  - Cross-border contracts are complex
  - Creators fear misuse abroad; companies fear accidental infringement
- Fragmented communication
  - Inquiries arrive via Twitter, Discord, email, or agencies
  - No centralized “voice licensing page”
- Lost revenue
  - VTuber demand is rising, but deals fail due to unclear terms or agency overtake

## 2. Illustrators / Character Designers — “DM Chaos”

Illustration IP fuels modern entertainment, yet licensing depends on ad-hoc DMs and PDF contracts.

- Licensing lives in DMs
  - Twitter/Instagram messages with no structured intake or templates
- Commercial and secondary use is unclear
  - Regions, platforms, duration, and exclusivity are often undefined
- No history of rights transfers
  - No record of past clients, duration, or permission scope → legal conflicts
- Companies lack trusted sources
  - Hard to verify ownership, commercial rights, or included assets (e.g., model sheets)
- Demand is growing without infrastructure
  - Global commissions but “DM + PDF contract” culture persists

## 3. Choreographers / Dancers — “Viral but Unpaid”

Choreography goes viral on TikTok/YouTube/Instagram, yet lacks standardized licensing.

- Viral usage without compensation or attribution
- No contract templates for dance IP (ads, events, TV/CM, TikTok challenges)
- Cross-border usage is untracked → lost revenue
- High legal risk for companies that unknowingly infringe
- Zero digital infrastructure
  - No listing pages, standard terms, digital approvals, or rights/payment logs

## 4. Company-Side Problems — “We Want IP, But It’s Scary”

Agencies, studios, and brands face their own blockers.

- Ownership uncertainty
  - Especially for VTuber voice assets, character art, choreography, and indie creators
- No standardized contract or approval flow
  - Rights clearance is manual; long email threads; rules differ by creator
- High legal risk
  - Infringement claims, PR damage, takedowns; legal teams over-block usage
- Complex international usage
  - Regions, duration, exclusivity, media channels rarely defined upfront
- Inefficient discovery
  - No marketplace for voice/choreography rights or transparent illustrator listings

## 5. Core IP Licensing Problem

IP demand is exploding globally, but licensing infrastructure is still analog.

- Creators: unclear pricing, contracts, usage rights; fear of misuse abroad
- Companies: unclear ownership, pricing norms, legal boundaries; fear of lawsuits
- Missing system: pricing, usage terms, contact/inquiry/approval, rights logs, international consistency

IP Connect exists to solve this multi-billion-dollar gap.
