## 1. Market Drivers (Global)

- Creator economy: $250B in 2024 → projected $480B by 2027; IP licensing is a core revenue stream

## 3. Category Validation

### Voice Actor / VTuber

- Voice-over market: $10B+ with AI voice, localization, and VTuber demand

## 4. Competitor Landscape

| Category | Players | Weakness (Why IP Connect wins) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Illustration sites | Pixiv, Skeb | No rights or license workflow |
| Audio / SFX | Voice123, Fiverr | Gig-focused, not IP licensing |
| Animation / Characters | Shutterstock | Stock-only, not original IP licensing |
| Dance IP | None | Completely untapped segment |
| Rights blockchain | Story Protocol | Registration only; no licensing workflow |
| Creator tools | Fanbox, Patreon | Monetization only; no IP rights clarity |

IP Connect is the only multi-category IP licensing infrastructure covering voice, illustration, and choreography with a unified workflow.

## 5. Market Positioning

Two-axis view:

- **X-axis:** Standardization of licensing workflow
- **Y-axis:** Originality of IP

IP Connect targets the upper-right quadrant: original IP with a standardized global licensing workflow. Legacy platforms cluster in lower quadrants (stock assets or ad-hoc gig commissions) without rights clarity.
