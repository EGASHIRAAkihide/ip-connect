# 08_GoToMarket — IP Connect

## Overview

GTM emphasizes rapid creator adoption (voice actors, illustrators, choreographers) and immediate utility for companies (agencies, game studios, VTuber groups). Network effects start with a focused wedge and expand to adjacent categories and regions.

---

## 1. Core GTM Strategy

- **Step 1 — Voice Actors / VTubers (beachhead):** strong demand, clear monetization/terms, cross-border need, weak competition.
- **Step 2 — Illustration & Character IP:** add illustrators, character designers, PNGtuber/Live2D designers once voice flow is stable.
- **Step 3 — Choreography:** capture the underserved dance IP segment to accelerate network effects.

Result: a triangular ecosystem where voice + illustration + choreography create cross-use opportunities.

## 2. Creator Acquisition (Supply)

YC 的「最初の100ユーザー」重視で、まずクリエイターを確保する。

- **Direct outreach:** DM 300–500 creators on X; focus on freelance/indie VTubers; offer free licensing page, usage templates, pricing guidance. Targets: Month 1 → 100 creators; Month 3 → 300 creators.
- **Creator communities:** VTuber Discords, voice actor schools, illustration schools, creator Facebook/Reddit groups. Partner with 3 communities by Month 2 as “official licensing support.”
- **Early access program:** provide early supporter badge and priority listing.
- **Referral program:** “Bring 3 creators → 1 month of Pro free” to drive viral loops.

## 3. Company Acquisition (Demand)

### Target buyer segments
- VTuber agencies, indie/mobile game studios, anime production teams
- Ad agencies（SNS広告）, AI companies needing safe voice datasets
- TikTok/YouTube creators needing voice lines

### Sales approach
- **Direct sales (early):** 50 VTuber agencies, 50 game studios, 30 ad agencies → goal: 20 active companies by Month 3.
- **Use-case playbooks:** “Voice Licensing for Indies,” “VTuber Voice Replacement Contracts,” “Choreography Rights for Ads.” Companies value clarity over inspiration.
- **Compliance/legal hook:** core message = “Use IP Connect to avoid copyright risk.” Legal clarity builds immediate trust.

---

## 4. Content Marketing

- **Educational content:** pricing guides for voice actors, “Illustration Commercial Rights 101,” “Choreography Licensing 101,” “Global IP usage rules explained.” Attracts creators seeking clarity and companies seeking compliance.
- **SNS:** X, Instagram, YouTube, TikTok; cadence 2–3 posts/week + 1 long-form weekly.
- **Case studies:** real licensing examples to drive credibility and growth.

---

## 5. Launch Plan (First 90 Days)

- **Phase 1 — Pre-launch (Week 1–3):** complete PoC; recruit 50 voice actors, 10 illustrators, 5 choreographers.
- **Phase 2 — Soft launch (Month 1–2):** launch MVP, start inbound licensing, collect testimonials, publish creator success stories. Goal: 100 creators onboard, 20 licensing deals.
- **Phase 3 — Hard launch (Month 3):** open global access, PR launch (“The first IP licensing infrastructure for creators”), run creator referral program, attend industry events.
