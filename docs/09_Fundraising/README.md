# 09_Fundraising — IP Connect

## Overview

IP Connect is raising a pre-seed round to accelerate MVP development, run the PoC at scale, and prepare for YC/seed within 6–12 months. Strategy: show clear problem validation, a workable MVP, strong founder–market fit, large global market, and fast path to revenue.

## 1. Why Investors Should Care

“Digital creators and companies lack a standard way to license IP safely.” The opportunity is:

- Large: $100B+ global TAM
- Underserved: no unified competitors
- Urgent: AI era heightens rights risk
- Scalable: marketplace + SaaS + API

Investors actively seek creator economy infra, IP rights management, AI-safe content supply, and cross-border content platforms. IP Connect fits all four.

- **Raise:** $300k–$500k USD (¥45M–¥75M)

## 4. Fundraising Narrative (Pitch Story)

1. **Problem is huge and growing:** IP demand is global; licensing is still DM/PDF/email; AI increases risk; creators lack pricing and rights clarity.
2. **Existing tools don’t solve rights:** Skeb/Pixiv/Fiverr/Shutterstock handle commissions or stock, not licensing workflow; Story Protocol is registry-only.
3. **Solution is clear:** listing pages, usage terms, inquiry → approval flow, rights logs, global access.
4. **Founder–market fit:** creator background (dance/entertainment) + PM/engineer skills (Next.js, Supabase, SaaS) + IP/legal awareness.
5. **Early signals:** PoC creators recruited, agency interest, strong pain validation, ready to ship MVP.
6. **Large market with expansion path:** Voice → Illustration → Choreography → Enterprise API → Global rights network.
7. **Revenue path:** 15% transaction fees; Creator SaaS ($15–$49/mo); Company SaaS ($99–$399/mo); Enterprise API (rights verification).
